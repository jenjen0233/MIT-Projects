# Loan Default Prediction

## **Problem Definition**

### **The Context:**
Loan Default Prediction is an important solution for financial institution as it helps prevent defaults, which can lead to significant financial losses, while also ensuring that creditworthy applicants are not unfairly rejected. Accurately identifying potential defaulters, the company can minimize losses and optimize profits.


### **The objective:**

 The goal is to build a predictive model to accurately predict whether an applicant is likely to default on a loan given their credit history or other characteristics.

### **The key questions:**

- What are key features of applicants that are most associated to loan default risk?
- What are the possible losses if the model predicts wrong?
- What are the risks associated with the chosen model, and how can they be quantified or mitigated?
- Is the chosen model interpretable, and can it provide clear decision-making rationale for applicants or stakeholders?

### **The problem formulation**:

- What is it that we are trying to solve using data science?  
Banking industry is important in every aspect of society. Making a loan to consolidate debt, make home improvement or any other reasons is important for applicant. Such a decision whether or not approve a loan request is important and it is crucial that the bank is able to approve the loan to the right applicant and make sure the loan could be repaid.

- We are exploring the relationship between independent variable and dependent variables, building  a predictive model that best predict the likelihood of being default on a loan given the applicant's credit history (the independent variables).

- Use the labeled data, we are training a predictive model, optimizing the loss, and choosing the best model with consideration of the most approriate business expenses and context. We will evaluate the performance of models on the test dataset and depend on the approriate cost we can tolerate, we choose the best model for our business context.
